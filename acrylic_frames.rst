Acrylic transilluminator frames
================================

Each kit includes one transilluminator frame. Several frame sizes are available: Mini, Midi or Large.

Frames are 7.5" x 10.5" and are laser cut from 0.25" black acrylic. They have a cutout designed to fit our range of blue LED transilluminators.

Cutout sizes:

* Mini frame -  7.5 cm x 13.4 cm 
* Midi frame -  13.5 cm x 15.7 cm
* Large frame - 20.6 cm x 16 cm

The frames help to position the gel viewing area and prevent the transilluminator from moving during photography.

Four corner mounting holes for mounting into the enclosure.
