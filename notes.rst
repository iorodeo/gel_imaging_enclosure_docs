Additional Notes
========================

The magentic latch on the enclosure is very strong. This can make it almost too hard to open sometimes, especially with one hand on the door and one hand holding a gel tray. 
We found that by placing 2-3 layers of tape (Scotch tape, electrical tape etc.) over the magnetic plate, the door is easier to open/close.
