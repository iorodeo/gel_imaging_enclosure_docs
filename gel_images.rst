You should be able to view your gel through the amber filter that is mounted inside the enclosure. You can re-position the gel if necessary.

With the smartphone imaging top, the viewing window is much smaller - 12.7 mm versus 74 mm. But you can still view the gel easily through this window and do any re-positioning you need to.
